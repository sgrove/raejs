RAEJS Web Framework
===================

Most frameworks make your want to RAGEQUIT. RAEJS might not be any different in that respect, but we don't care. It works for us.

About
-----

It's a rails-inspired framework for node.js. That means it's opinionated, and it uses a lot of magic. It also means it just works.

It uses a meta-self-documenting system. Read any object's documentation via object.doc().

TODO
----
 * Use the jZenDoc system to generate static documentation
 * Database-preparation scripts (things like generating views automagically, etc.)
